## üìã How to Use dashboard_queries.sql

The `dashboard_queries.sql` file contains all the SQL queries you need for creating charts in Superset. Here's how to use it:

### **Step-by-Step Manual Chart Creation**

1. **Open Superset** and go to **SQL Lab**
2. **Copy a query** from `dashboard_queries.sql`
3. **Paste it** into SQL Lab and run it
4. **Save as Dataset** if the query works
5. **Create Chart** from that dataset manually

**Example:**
```sql
-- Copy this from dashboard_queries.sql (lines 7-10)
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_trips
FROM iceberg.silver.fact_trip
WHERE quality_issue = 'good';
```

### **Learning Approach**

Study the queries to understand:
- How to join fact and dimension tables
- How to calculate derived fields
- How to filter data properly
- How to structure SQL for different chart types

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always test queries** in SQL Lab before creating charts
2. **Use the quality filter**: `WHERE quality_issue = 'good'`
3. **Start with simple queries** and build complexity
4. **Save working queries** as datasets for reuse
5. **Use the calculated fields** (like `tip_percentage`) in your charts

## üñºÔ∏è How to Configure Each Chart in Superset

This section provides explicit, step-by-step instructions for configuring each main chart in Superset. Use this as a reference when building your dashboard manually.

    COUNT(*) as trip_count,
    SUM(ft.totalamount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(ft.fareamount) as avg_fare
FROM iceberg.silver.fact_trip ft
LEFT JOIN iceberg.silver.dimpayment p ON ft.paymenttypeid = p.paymenttypeid
WHERE ft.quality_issue = 'good' AND p.paymenttype IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.paymenttype
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

```

3. **Chart Type**: Big Number
4. **Metrics (Y-Axis)**: `SUM(trip_count)`
5. **Dimensions**: *(leave empty)*
6. **Save the chart**

---

**Tips:**
- The **Y-axis** is always defined by the **Metrics** field in Superset.
- For time series charts, set the **X-Axis** to your date column and choose the appropriate **Time Grain**.
- For bar and pie charts, use **Dimensions** to group by a column (e.g., borough, payment type).
- If you don't see the metric you want, you can create a custom metric (e.g., `SUM(trip_count)` or `COUNT(*)`).
- Always test your dataset in SQL Lab first to ensure the columns exist.

Now, follow the manual step-by-step flow below to build your dashboard!
