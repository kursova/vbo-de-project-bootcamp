NYC Yellow Taxi Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project aims to uncover strategic insights into urban mobility by analyzing New York Cityâ€™s yellow taxi trip data. Using data provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) in Parquet format, we apply core data engineering processes to transform raw data into meaningful and interactive visual outputs.
